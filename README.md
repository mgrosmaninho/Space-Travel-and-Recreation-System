# Space-Travel-and-Recreation-System
Coursework from University of Hertfordshire

## Overview
A control system for the STARS organization. This organization manages a number of resorts offering space travel and recreation facilities. These resorts always consist of a number of worlds offering different leisure facilities. Each world is connected by shuttles to some of the other worlds at the resort. A card must be used to take a shuttle to journey to another world. Credits can be bought for cards, and these are used when making a shuttle journey. However, there are a number of conditions that need to be met before anyone (card) can use a card for a shuttle journey.

I developed the Java code for the system in BlueJ and added the following functionalities:
1. Displays details of the whole resort
2. Lists all cards on all worlds of the resort
3. Lists all cards currently on a specified world
4. Finds the current location of a card
5. Authorises a shuttle journey, if it meets the required conditions
6. Top-up a cardâ€™s credits
7. Converts points to credits
8. Records an emergency move of a card (person) back to the Homeworld
9. Records the evacuation of all cards (person) to the Homeworld.
