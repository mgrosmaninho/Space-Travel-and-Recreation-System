# Space-Travel-and-Recreation-System
Coursework from University of Hertfordshire

## Overview
In a galaxy far away, the Space Travel and Recreation System (STARS) organisation manages several resorts offering space travel and recreation facilities. These resorts always consist of several worlds offering different leisure facilities. Each world is connected by shuttles to some of the other worlds at the resort. A card must be used to take a shuttle to journey to another world. Credits can be bought for cards, and these are used when making a shuttle journey. However, many conditions need to be met before anyone can use a card for a shuttle journey.
